## Description

Created by Colin Laganier, Alexandre Berkovic, Megan Hale and Louis Horrell as part of DE2 Big Data Module.

A model to predict the nightly price of an Airbnb listing in New York City was made using a dataset of Airbnb listings, of Zillow real estate values and Google Places venues of interest. The premise of the model is to recommend a suitable nightly price for a newly listed property on the platform. 

This project was created coraboratively using Google Colab.
